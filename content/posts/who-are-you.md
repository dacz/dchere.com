## Imagine

Simple game. Tic-tac-toe.

Choose **x** or **o** stone.

Play a round and then your opponent.

Maybe I win, maybe I loose, maybe it's a draw. Winner and looser.

But what if…

… each round your stone is chosen by a chance? 
And the same for your playmate.

Who is the winner and who is the looser? 

Is there any looser?

[**Try by yourself.**](/ttt)

How did you play?
