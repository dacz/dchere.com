# Hi!

I [did a lot of things](/cv/) (it's kinda CV there) and plan to do some more. I'm open to collaborate or work with you or for you, if you want to make great things.

I'm curious, and regulary asking myself what happens, if we don't take the established status quo for granted.

Don't believe me (I don't believe myself, too), but use your brain. Don't be upset on me - these are just words you can forget immediatelly.

I know that I may be wrong (which happens very often) and I'm glad for any feedback.

~ David
