# Packaging With Personal Touch

## Trash and dance!

I'm thinking about the designer of this packaging (a boring everyday snack, no fancy brand). What does it take to NOT use existing established sign "trash it" (least effort taken), but create something that can make someone who sees this easter egg, smile?

Well done! I love it!ðŸ’ƒ
