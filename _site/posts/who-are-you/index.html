<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúWho are YOU?‚Äù</p>
<p>This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI--I hardly know, sir, just at present-- at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.‚Äù</p>

<h2>Imagine</h2>
<p>Simple game. Tic-tac-toe.</p>
<p>Choose <strong>x</strong> or <strong>o</strong> stone.</p>
<p>Play a round and then your opponent.</p>
<p>Maybe I win, maybe I loose, maybe it's a draw. Winner and looser.</p>
<p>But what if‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚Ä¶ each round your stone is chosen by a chance?
And the same for your playmate.</p>
<p>Who are you? The winner or the looser?</p>
<p>Or is there any looser at all?</p>
<p><a href="/tic-tac-toe/"><strong>Try by yourself.</strong></a></p>
<p>How did you play?</p>
