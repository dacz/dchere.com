## Imagine

Simple game. Tic-tac-toe.

Choose **x** or **o** stone.

Play a round and then your opponent.

Maybe I win, maybe I loose, maybe it's a draw. Winner and looser.

But what if…

… each round your stone is chosen by a chance? 
And the same for your playmate.

Who are you? The winner or the looser? 

Or is there any looser at all?

[**Try by yourself.**](/tic-tac-toe/)

How did you play?
