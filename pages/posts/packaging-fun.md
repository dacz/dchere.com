# Packaging With Personal Touch

## Trash and dance!

I'm thinking about the designer of this packaging (a boring everyday snack, no fancy brand). What does it take to NOT use existing sign about "trash it" (least effort taken), but create something that can make someone who sees this easter eggs, smile?

Was it only the designer who made a graphical joke? Maybe it was a joyful subversion against the otherwise not-much-inspiring requirements? (The whole packaging of this product is ok but not very entertaining, which probably has to be because of all legal requirements?)

Maybe the manager participated? I doubt it.

Anyway - well done! I love it!💃

## Love letter

Spotted by my daughter. It's a brilliant way to tell something (not only) about packaging. Being a customer who bought it - I'm already in a good mood.

I think this one was not a subversion or a great joke. It feels like a team of enthusiastic people who care and think about details (because they love it) and have the green light from management.
