    <h1>Gramophone</h1>
    <div class="article-date">June 24, 2024 (edited: June 27, 2024)</div>
    <p>I found an old gramophone.</p>
<p>Not used for years. Some sliders and buttons needed excersize (one - two, min - max, one - two, up - down, one - two, min - max, ‚Ä¶ ). Like me in the morning (sometimes).</p>
<p>But it plays!</p>
<p>It's big. Was not easy to find a place for it. Once found, it is there - part of the room and part of the day.</p>
<p>Now it is the room with the gramophone.</p>
<p>One LP was in it. Old Balkanton version of Elvis hits.</p>
<p>The sound is different. I cannot find the word for difference. Maybe &quot;less artificial&quot;.</p>
<p>No easy skipping song. No shuffle. At the beginning I felt restlessness listening to song I did not like so much.</p>
<p>Later I found it relieving - listening, not interfering.</p>
<p>Where do I get another LPs?</p>
<p>I'll find a shop with used LPs, go there and manually list their LPs. Real LPs. No fulltext search but two hands search.</p>
<p>And I did it today. Small shabby shop, full of old LPs. With two older guys who apparently love rock - probably shop owners - playing LPs with a passion.</p>
<p>It was hard to choose one. But I did and bring it home.</p>

<p>It feels stupid to write &quot;I bring it home&quot;. But last time I remember she same feeling was maybe 35 years ago when I bought Pink Floyd LP and was very careful not to break on my way home.</p>
<p>It feels melancholic. Maybe it is, maybe not. I put Dire Strait I bought on, tuned it up and listened to it. I like even the cracks.</p>
