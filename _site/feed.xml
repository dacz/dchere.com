&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m thinking about the designer of this packaging (a boring everyday snack, no fancy brand). What does it take to NOT use existing established sign &amp;quot;trash it&amp;quot; (least effort taken), but create something that can make someone who sees this easter egg, smile?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well done! I love it!ðŸ’ƒ&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Developer experience is a common sense</title>
    <link href="https://dchere.com/posts/devex-common-sense/"/>
    <updated>2023-11-12T00:00:00Z</updated>

    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Developer experience - DevEx - DX&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m interested in DX. Why? I consider myself to be a developer. So I have first-hand experience with when DX works and when not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it is frustrating. So. Much. Not because of technical problems. Developers usually love technical challenges. Surprisingly, they don&#39;t mind working on tight deadlines, if needed. What ruins their day (and productivity) is when they are not let to deliver solution. It sounds weirs, doesn&#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine the restaurant - you will unlikely go somewhere where you had a bad experience. But you will frequently eat at the one where you feel good. You feel good because the staff is friendly and nice, not stressed or frustrated (and sure they have a good meal). You watch the place, and you see a well-functioning organism. The restaurant thrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone can more or less imagine what the chef needs (and hates). Developers&#39; needs are far from well-known. Misunderstanding, downplaying, or ignoring these needs is a sure way to ruin their experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good experience creates happiness and, in the organization, it enhances effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is that simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers usually don&#39;t meet customers, so why care about their experience? First of all, it is because of better effectivity, as discussed. Another good reason is that the software is everywhere. Crappy software sucks and frustrates - customers or internal users. No developer wants to make buggy software, same as no chef wants to make a bad meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizations care about their people, not only because they want to, for whatever human or social reasons, but because they see that having happy people around is usually more profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developer experience is not a science. And no - having engineering lead or engineering manager doesn&#39;t mean you are caring about DX.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bullshit Jobs (by David Graeber)</title>

    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Book: Bullshit Jobs by David Graeber&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year ago, I read &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dawn_of_Everything&quot;&gt;The Dawn of Everything&lt;/a&gt; by David Graeber and David Wengrow. It felt like fresh air for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I stumbled upon his other books (thanks to my daughter), and Bullshit Jobs is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brilliant intro is his essay &lt;a href=&quot;https://strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs/&quot;&gt;On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs&lt;/a&gt; he wrote in 2013. The article provoked massive reactions. The book goes much deeper, and draws from many conversations he had and other sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a kind of book where one has to be able to re-think many ideas that are considered matter-of-fact. No, they are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#39;t pick up one thing. For sure, I cannot offer a summary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To pick up some - controversial indeed - takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes, we could work only 20 hours per week - if there weren&#39;t bullshit jobs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No, capitalism doesn&#39;t make everything effective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many (most?) organizations have a similar structure as feudal society (with all the layers of feudal lords, retainers, and vassals).&lt;/li&gt;

    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Cyanotype and the Joy of The Moment&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://dchere.com/img/cyano_small_branch1-CD65KljUjz-700.webp 700w, https://dchere.com/img/cyano_small_branch1-CD65KljUjz-1152.webp 1152w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 756px) 80vw, (min-width: 757px) 576px&quot;&gt;

    &lt;img src=&quot;https://dchere.com/img/cyano_small_branch1-CD65KljUjz-1152.webp&quot; width=&quot;1152&quot; height=&quot;1536&quot; alt=&quot;Cyanotype - moment&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanotype&quot;&gt;Cyanotype&lt;/a&gt; is joyful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you paint some chemicals on the paper and let it dry in darkness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;then you lay some things (leaves etc.) on the paper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;leave it on the direct sun for a couple of minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the last step is washing the paper in the water (developing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was in the shadow (like masked by leaves) becomes white-ish. Parts exposed to the sunrays, becomes beautifully blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://dchere.com/img/cyano_leaf-U73gZwcoq9-700.webp 700w, https://dchere.com/img/cyano_leaf-U73gZwcoq9-1152.webp 1152w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 756px) 80vw, (min-width: 757px) 576px&quot;&gt;
&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://dchere.com/img/cyano_leaf-U73gZwcoq9-700.jpeg 700w, https://dchere.com/img/cyano_leaf-U73gZwcoq9-1152.jpeg 1152w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 756px) 80vw, (min-width: 757px) 576px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://dchere.com/img/cyano_leaf-U73gZwcoq9-1152.webp&quot; width=&quot;1152&quot; height=&quot;1536&quot; alt=&quot;Cyanotype - going bigger&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is so much space for unintended effects, and randomness (when the wind blows and moves your leaves). The result is very much done by chance, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://dchere.com/img/cyano_2colors_fish-eC3ajPMvJ4-700.webp 700w, https://dchere.com/img/cyano_2colors_fish-eC3ajPMvJ4-1152.webp 1152w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 756px) 80vw, (min-width: 757px) 576px&quot;&gt;
&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://dchere.com/img/cyano_2colors_fish-eC3ajPMvJ4-700.jpeg 700w, https://dchere.com/img/cyano_2colors_fish-eC3ajPMvJ4-1152.jpeg 1152w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 756px) 80vw, (min-width: 757px) 576px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://dchere.com/img/cyano_2colors_fish-eC3ajPMvJ4-1152.webp&quot; width=&quot;1152&quot; height=&quot;862&quot; alt=&quot;Cyanotype - making it 2 color&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a way to make it yellow and blue. The part of the image that takes a bath in baking soda for 8 hours turns yellow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is much more effort than taking a picture by mobile phone, ðŸ˜‰ but it is worth it. You can even do a kind of photos.&lt;/p&gt;
