# Welcome...

...to my website. Let me introduce myself a bit.

I [did a lot of things](/about/) and hopefully will do some more.

I like to make new things, read books, take photos... Most of all, I'm curious. For example, what happens if we don't take the established status quo for granted? I believe in quality, not quantity.

I'm writing my [ideas and texts](/posts/) here not to try to convince anybody about my point of view. If anything here resonates with you or makes your day a bit better for a while, it's like a smile from someone on the sidewalk.
