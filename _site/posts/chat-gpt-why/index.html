            <h1>Chat with GPT... why?</h1>
<p>Many many years ago I've read a book about &quot;<a href="https://www.debonogroup.com/services/core-programs/six-thinking-hats/">Six Thinking Hats (r)</a>&quot; (even before it became trademarked thing... ðŸ™ˆ. This one has a <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/six-thinking-hats">nice explanation</a> from Atlassian).</p>
<p>I like to think about various topic from as many angles as possible. Sometimes to question even the most basic assumptions everyone has.</p>
<p>ChatGPT can play interesting role in the process. It can be asked to summarize the topic and it does it well. But there is more - it can be asked to play some role, it can be asked to persuade, it can be asked to be critical. Do not take the twists, pros, cons, arguments with face value, but as a material to think about. After all is is &quot;only chatGPT&quot;.</p>
