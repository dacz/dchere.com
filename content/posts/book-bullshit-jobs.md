# Book: Bullshit Jobs by David Graeber

{% image "content/img/book_bullshit_jobs.jpeg", "Book: Bullshit Jobs - David Graeber" %}

A year ago, I read [The Dawn of Everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dawn_of_Everything) by David Graeber and David Wengrow. It felt like fresh air for me.

Recently I stumbled upon his other books (thanks to my daughter), and Bullshit Jobs is one of them.

Brilliant intro is his essay [On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs](https://strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs/) he wrote in 2013. The article provoked massive reactions. The book goes much deeper, and draws from many conversations he had and other sources.

It's a kind of book where one has to be able to re-think many ideas that are considered matter-of-fact. No, they are not.

I can't pick up one thing. For sure, I cannot offer a summary. 

To pick up some - controversial indeed - takeaways:

 * Yes, we could work only 20 hours per week - if there weren't bullshit jobs.
 * No, capitalism doesn't make everything effective.
 * Many (most?) organizations have a similar structure as feudal society (with all the layers of feudal lords, retainers, and vassals).
