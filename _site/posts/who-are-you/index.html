            <h1>Who are you?</h1>
<p>“Who are YOU?”
This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly,
“I--I hardly know, sir, just at present-- at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.”</p>
<p>― Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland</p>
<p>Simple game. Tic-tac-toe.</p>
<p>Choose <strong>x</strong> or <strong>o</strong> stone.</p>
<p>Play a round and then your opponent.</p>
<p>Maybe I win, maybe I loose, maybe it's a draw. Winner and looser.</p>
<p>But what if…</p>
<p>… each round your stone is chosen by a chance? And for your playmate, too?</p>
<p>Who is the winner and who is the looser?</p>
<p>Is there any looser?</p>
<p>PLAY THE GAME</p>
<p>How did you play?</p>
