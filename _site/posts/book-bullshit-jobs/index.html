<p>A year ago, I read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dawn_of_Everything">The Dawn of Everything</a> by David Graeber and David Wengrow. It felt like fresh air for me.</p>
<p>Recently I stumbled upon his other books (thanks to my daughter), and Bullshit Jobs is one of them.</p>
<p>Brilliant intro is his essay <a href="https://strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs/">On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs</a> he wrote in 2013. The article provoked massive reactions. The book goes much deeper, and draws from many conversations he had and other sources.</p>
<p>It's a kind of book where one has to be able to re-think many ideas that are considered matter-of-fact. No, they are not.</p>
<p>I can't pick up one thing. For sure, I cannot offer a summary.</p>
<p>To pick up some - controversial indeed - takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, we could work only 20 hours per week - if there weren't bullshit jobs.</li>
<li>No, capitalism doesn't make everything effective.</li>
<li>Many (most?) organizations have a similar structure as feudal society (with all the layers of feudal lords, retainers, and vassals).</li>
</ul>
