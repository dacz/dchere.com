# Cyanotype and the Joy of The Moment

{% image "img/cyano_small_branch.jpeg", "Cyanotype - moment" %}

[Cyanotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanotype) is a joyful activity!

Summary: 
 * you paint some chemicals on the paper and let it dry
 * then you lay on the paper some things (leaves etc.) 
 * leave it on the direct sun for a couple of minutes
 * the last step is washing the paper in the water (developing)

What was in the shadow (like masked by leaves) becomes white-ish. Parts exposed to the sunrays, becomes beautifully blue.

There is so much space for unintended effects, and randomness (when the wind blows and moves your leaves). I love it. The result is not mine but done by chance.

There is a way to make it yellow and blue. The part of the image that takes a bath in baking soda for 8 hours turns yellow.

It is much more effort than taking a picture by mobile phone, ðŸ˜‰ but it is worth it.

You can even do a kind of photos.
