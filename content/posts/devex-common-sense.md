title: Developer Experience is a Common Sense

I'm interested in developer experience (DevEx or DX). Why? I consider myself to be a developer. So I have first-hand experience with when DX works and when not.

Sometimes, it is frustrating. So. Much. Not because of technical problems. Developers usually love technical challenges. Surprisingly, they don't mind working on tight deadlines, if needed. What ruins their day (and productivity) is when they are not let to deliver solution. It sounds weirs, doesn't it?

Imagine the restaurant - you will unlikely go somewhere where you had a bad experience. But you will frequently eat at the one where you feel good. You feel good because the staff is friendly and nice, not stressed or frustrated (and sure they have a good meal). You watch the place, and you see a well-functioning organism. The restaurant thrives.

Everyone can more or less imagine what the chef needs (and hates). Developers' needs are far from well-known. Misunderstanding, downplaying, or ignoring these needs is a sure way to ruin their experience.

Good experience creates happiness and, in the organization, it enhances effectiveness.

It is that simple. 

Developers usually don't meet customers, so why care about their experience? First of all, it is because of better effectivity, as discussed. Another good reason is that the software is everywhere. Crappy software sucks and frustrates - customers or internal users. No developer wants to make buggy software, same as no chef wants to make a bad meal.

Organizations care about their people, not only because they want to, for whatever human or social reasons, but because they see that having happy people around is usually more profitable.

Developer experience is not a science. And no - having an Engineering Lead or Engineering Manager doesn't automatically mean you care about DX.

It's not completely related (except the word "experience"), but I think it is funny, it's to the point, and I should follow this advice.
