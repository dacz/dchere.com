# Cyanotype and Marvelous Accidents

{% image "content/img/cyano_small_branch1.jpeg", "Cyanotype - moment" %}

[Cyanotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanotype) is joyful!

Summary: 
 * you paint some chemicals on the paper and let it dry in darkness
 * then you lay some things (leaves etc.) on the paper
 * leave it on the direct sun for a couple of minutes
 * the last step is washing the paper in the water (developing)

What was in the shadow (like masked by leaves) becomes white-ish. Parts exposed to the sunrays, becomes beautifully blue.

There is so much space for unintended effects, and randomness (when the wind blows and moves your leaves). The result is very much done by chance, too.

There is a way to make it yellow and blue. The part of the image that takes a bath in baking soda for 8 hours turns yellow.

You can even do a kind of photos.
