# Developer experience - DevEx - DX

I'm interested in DX. Why? I consider myself to be a developer. So I have first-hand experience with when DX works and when not.

Sometimes, it is frustrating. So. Much. Not because of technical problems. Developers usually love technical challenges. Surprisingly, they don't mind working on tight deadlines, if needed. What ruins their day (and productivity) is when they have to explain, again and again, what they need to develop and deliver software.

Imagine the restaurant - you will unlikely go somewhere where you had a bad experience. But you will frequently eat at the one where you feel good. You feel good because the staff is friendly and nice, not stressed or frustrated (and sure they have a good meal). You watch the place, and you see a well-functioning organism. The restaurant thrives.

Everyone can more or less imagine what the chef needs. Developers' needs are far from well-known. Misunderstanding, downplaying, or ignoring these needs is a sure way to ruin their experience.

Good experience creates happiness and, in the organization, it enhances effectiveness.

It is that simple. 

Developers usually don't meet customers, so why care about their experience? First of all, it is because of better effectivity, as discussed. Another good reason is that the software is everywhere. Crappy software sucks and frustrates - customers or internal users. No developer wants to make buggy software, same as no chef wants to make a bad meal. Give them good conditions - good experience - and it will work better.

Organizations care about their people, not only because they want to, for whatever human or social reasons, but because they see that having happy people around is usually more profitable.

Let's go back to developer experience.

Is it complicated to start with it?

It is not when you have the big picture internalized - happy people bring more value to the organization.

The rule is the same to achieve anything else (playing piano, running a marathon). Just do it, track it, and stick with it.

In my [previous post](chat-gpt-dev-ex), I had fun asking chat GPT as someone new to DX. GPT nicely summarized the basics.

You can see that it's common sense. You do not have to spend a ridiculously high amount of money on it (well, you can, but ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

It boils down to a few points:

(1) **You care** about developer experience (it seems a matter-of-fact, but sometimes it isn't),<br />
(2) you **assign** it to someone who will be responsible for it and <br />
(3) **enable** her to do it (people usually use the word "empower").<br />
(4) **Measure** and **enhance** (widely expressed as rinse&repeat).<br />

(_Sure, the most important requirement is having developers at your organization._)

DX is not another fancy technique or methodology. It is simply about (developers') **experience** (see the lower 'e') and how to enhance it. Because **it brings more value to the organization**. It is a mindset, not prescribed "how to do it" (with some trademark or copyright attached).
