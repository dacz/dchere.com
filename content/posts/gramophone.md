I found an old gramophone.

Not used for years. Some sliders and buttons needed excersize (one - two, min - max, one - two, up - down, one - two, min - max, â€¦ ). Like me in the morning (sometimes).

But it plays!

It's big. Was not easy to find a place for it. Once found, it is there - part of the room and part of the day.

Now it is the room with the gramophone.

One LP was in it. Old Balkanton version of Elvis hits.

The sound is different. I cannot find the word for difference. Maybe "less artificial".

No easy skipping song. No shuffle. At the beginning I felt restlessness listening to song I did not like so much.

Later I found it relieving - listening, not interfering.

Where do I get another LPs?

I'll find a shop with used LPs, go there and manually list their LPs. Real LPs. No fulltext search but two hands search.

And I did it today. Small shabby shop, full of old LPs. With two older guys who apparently love rock - probably shop owners - playing LPs with a passion. 

It was hard to choose one. But I did and bring it home.

It feels stupid to write "I bring it home". But last time I remember she same feeling was maybe 35 years ago when I bought Pink Floyd LP and was very careful not to break on my way home. 

It feels melancholic. Maybe it is, maybe not. I put Dire Strait I bought on, tuned it up and listened to it. I like even the cracks.
