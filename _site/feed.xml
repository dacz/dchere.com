&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWho are YOU?‚Äù
This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly,
‚ÄúI--I hardly know, sir, just at present-- at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äï Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Imagine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple game. Tic-tac-toe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose &lt;strong&gt;x&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;o&lt;/strong&gt; stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Play a round and then your opponent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I win, maybe I loose, maybe it&#39;s a draw. Winner and looser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶ each round your stone is chosen by a chance?
And the same for your playmate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is the winner and who is the looser?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there any looser?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dchere.com/ttt&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try by yourself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gramophone</title>
    <link href="https://dchere.com/posts/gramophone/"/>
    <updated>2024-06-24T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://dchere.com/posts/gramophone/</id>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Gramophone&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found an old gramophone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not used for years. Some sliders and buttons needed excersize (one - two, min - max, one - two, up - down, one - two, min - max, ‚Ä¶ ). Like me in the morning (sometimes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it plays!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s big. Was not easy to find a place for it. Once found, it is there - part of the room and part of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it is the room with the gramophone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One LP was in it. Old Balkanton version of Elvis hits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sound is different. I cannot find the word for difference. Maybe &amp;quot;less artificial&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No easy skipping song. No shuffle. At the beginning I felt restlessness listening to song I did not like so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later I found it relieving - listening, not interfering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where do I get another LPs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll find a shop with used LPs, go there and manually list their LPs. Real LPs. No fulltext search but two hands search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I did it today. Small shabby shop, full of old LPs. With two older guys who apparently love rock - probably shop owners - playing LPs with a passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was hard to choose one. But I did and bring it home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels stupid to write &amp;quot;I bring it home&amp;quot;. But last time I remember she same feeling was maybe 35 years ago when I bought Pink Floyd LP and was very careful not to break on my way home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels melancholic. Maybe it is, maybe not. I put Dire Strait I bought on, tuned it up and listened to it. I like even the cracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m thinking about the designer of this packaging (a boring everyday snack, no fancy brand). What does it take to NOT use existing established sign &amp;quot;trash it&amp;quot; (least effort taken), but create something that can make someone who sees this easter egg, smile?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well done! I love it!üíÉ&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Developer experience is a common sense</title>
    <link href="https://dchere.com/posts/devex-common-sense/"/>
    <updated>2023-11-12T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://dchere.com/posts/devex-common-sense/</id>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Developer experience - DevEx - DX&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m interested in DX. Why? I consider myself to be a developer. So I have first-hand experience with when DX works and when not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it is frustrating. So. Much. Not because of technical problems. Developers usually love technical challenges. Surprisingly, they don&#39;t mind working on tight deadlines, if needed. What ruins their day (and productivity) is when they are not let to deliver solution. It sounds weirs, doesn&#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine the restaurant - you will unlikely go somewhere where you had a bad experience. But you will frequently eat at the one where you feel good. You feel good because the staff is friendly and nice, not stressed or frustrated (and sure they have a good meal). You watch the place, and you see a well-functioning organism. The restaurant thrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone can more or less imagine what the chef needs (and hates). Developers&#39; needs are far from well-known. Misunderstanding, downplaying, or ignoring these needs is a sure way to ruin their experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good experience creates happiness and, in the organization, it enhances effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is that simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers usually don&#39;t meet customers, so why care about their experience? First of all, it is because of better effectivity, as discussed. Another good reason is that the software is everywhere. Crappy software sucks and frustrates - customers or internal users. No developer wants to make buggy software, same as no chef wants to make a bad meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizations care about their people, not only because they want to, for whatever human or social reasons, but because they see that having happy people around is usually more profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developer experience is not a science. And no - having an Engineering Lead or Engineering Manager doesn&#39;t mean you care about DX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: Just read &lt;a href=&quot;https://dynomight.net/advice/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If people have a good ‚Äúuser experience‚Äù when they interact with you, then they will want to interact with you more in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not completely related (except the word &amp;quot;experience&amp;quot;), but I think it is funny, it&#39;s to the point, and I should follow this advice.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bullshit Jobs (by David Graeber)</title>

  &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year ago, I read &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dawn_of_Everything&quot;&gt;The Dawn of Everything&lt;/a&gt; by David Graeber and David Wengrow. It felt like fresh air for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I stumbled upon his other books (thanks to my daughter), and Bullshit Jobs is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brilliant intro is his essay &lt;a href=&quot;https://strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs/&quot;&gt;On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs&lt;/a&gt; he wrote in 2013. The article provoked massive reactions. The book goes much deeper, and draws from many conversations he had and other sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a kind of book where one has to be able to re-think many ideas that are considered matter-of-fact. No, they are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#39;t pick up one thing. For sure, I cannot offer a summary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To pick up some - controversial indeed - takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes, we could work only 20 hours per week - if there weren&#39;t bullshit jobs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No, capitalism doesn&#39;t make everything effective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many (most?) organizations have a similar structure as feudal society (with all the layers of feudal lords, retainers, and vassals).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://dchere.com/img/cyano_small_branch1-CD65KljUjz-700.webp 700w, https://dchere.com/img/cyano_small_branch1-CD65KljUjz-1152.webp 1152w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 756px) 80vw, (min-width: 757px) 576px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanotype&quot;&gt;Cyanotype&lt;/a&gt; is joyful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you paint some chemicals on the paper and let it dry in darkness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;then you lay some things (leaves etc.) on the paper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;leave it on the direct sun for a couple of minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the last step is washing the paper in the water (developing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was in the shadow (like masked by leaves) becomes white-ish. Parts exposed to the sunrays, becomes beautifully blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://dchere.com/img/cyano_leaf-U73gZwcoq9-700.webp 700w, https://dchere.com/img/cyano_leaf-U73gZwcoq9-1152.webp 1152w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 756px) 80vw, (min-width: 757px) 576px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is so much space for unintended effects, and randomness (when the wind blows and moves your leaves). The result is very much done by chance, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://dchere.com/img/cyano_2colors_fish-eC3ajPMvJ4-700.webp 700w, https://dchere.com/img/cyano_2colors_fish-eC3ajPMvJ4-1152.webp 1152w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 756px) 80vw, (min-width: 757px) 576px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a way to make it yellow and blue. The part of the image that takes a bath in baking soda for 8 hours turns yellow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can even do a kind of photos.&lt;/p&gt;
